Dear Visitors,

We appreciate your interest in accessing the Fit2Ear Dataset. The dataset was uploaded [here](https://www.radar-service.eu/radar/en/dataset/LuEUQApwxQrvGfKm?token=SYlvgUzVOkJKorIUJICw#). However, the dataset is still under review due to data protection considerations and other related issues, which may take a few weeks to complete.

Certainly you can require access to the dataset before the review process is finalized, please feel free to contact the [author](mailto:haibin.zhao@kit.edu).
